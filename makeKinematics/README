/////////////// SEQUENCE ///////////////////////////
** see below for descriptions of files **

---- LPC with special EOS treatment -----
0. MiniAOD
1. LJMet --> N output files per MC sample, generic trees
2. step1.cc --> N output files per MC sample, smaller/lighter trees with analysis-specific calculations
3. haddoutput.py --> 1 output file per MC sample, except for splits: 6 output files per signal (BWBW, etc)
---- brux ----
4. On brux: cp.sh (or similar) --> xrdcp hadded files to brux
5. OPTIONAL: step2.cc -->  last minute changes to trees
6. samples.py/weights.py --> edit the files: did anything change? 
7. analyze.py --> define weights, define cuts (define cut on HT), etc. 
8. doHists.py --> define plots, give cut values (HT > 250), give bool settings
9. doCondorKinematics.py --> define output directory and which distributions to plot
----- WAIT FOR JOBS TO FINISH -----
10. doKinematics.py --> check sample lists for actual plots, check/edit normalization errors (makes latex yield tables)
11. plotAsymm.py --> PLOT.


/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The main code to make histograms is "makeKinematics.py":
To be modified by user (listed in the order as they appear in the script):
	- input directory (step1 or step2)
	- list of samples to be run for signals, backgrounds, and data
	- group the background processes into "ewk", "qcd", "top", "ttjets", 
	etc (no need to modify unless samples and thus their names change). Also, note that
	yields/plotting are setup for "ewk/top/qcd" grouped backgrounds. If detailed background
	processes wanted, the implementations has to be completed!
	- systematics: they have to be defined in "analyze.py" and corresponding samples must exist.
	The systematics can be turned off if only simple plots wanted without total uncertainty bands
	- Q^2 needs to be taken care of separately; currently (Dec 16, 2015) there is a hack since
	scaleDown samples does not exist. FIX THIS IF YOU HAVE THE SAMPLE
	- Give the list of cuts to be applied! New cuts can be included in "cutList" as long as
	they are also added in "analyze.py" to "cut" string and also add it to "cutString" variable in "makeTemplates.py"
	- modify the output directory names, etc
	- modify the normalization uncertainties
	- give the distributions to plot in "plotList" (given near the end). In the definition, give a name to distribution 
	as a key to the dictionary, name of the variable in ljmet trees, x-axis label, and the desired binning
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"analyze.py":
This does not need a modification, if you are only changing the cuts that are already there and 
using only the systematics defined there (or not using the systematics)
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"samples.py":
It needs definitions of all the samples that are being analyzed. This is for easy access to input files!
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"weights.py":
This is where primary MC weights are defined. Each sample again must have a defined weight here with
number of generated events, x-sec, and the luminosity
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
"makeKinematics.py" can be run interactively by simply doing "python makeKinematics.py".
If you want to run this with condor, use "makeCondorKinematics.py" and "makeCondorKinematics.sh". 
Before running condor scripts, "makeKinematics.py" has to be modified with the configuration wanted.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Once the templates for the kinematics are produced, they can be plotted with "plotKinematics.py".
	- template directory needs to be specified.
	- give 2 signals to show on the stack plots
	- do you have the systematics in the templates? If so, which ones (give the same names as the ones used in 
	"analyze.py")? Turn off the bools if you don't have the shapes
	- if you have the shape systematics, you can produce two types of plots; one with the uncertainty bands are separated in
	the lower panel and another one with only the total uncertainty band using "doOneBand".
	- check if you have the right normalization systematics, they will be added to error bands
	- give the list of kinematic distributions that you produced templates for
	- note that the "QCD" process will not be shown on the plots if it is less than 0.5% of the background
	- if you'd like to change plot labels, etc, use "formatLowerHist" and "formatUpperHist"
